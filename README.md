# Model-View-Controller----Flash-Card
This flash card demonstrates the architecture of MVC. Several models represent a database of tables which may be created using Code First or Databse First Approach.
The controller redirects user actions to specified endpoints and performs operations on the model based on the desired action.  
The View determines the user interface design.
